		content: `"I killed someone yesterday," you whispered, words barely audible beneath the soft, persistent rhythm of the rain. Standing drenched at my doorstep, your fragile figure was a silent plea for comfort—an unspoken yearning for reassurance. Rain streamed down your cheeks, blending seamlessly with the quiet grief etched upon your face.

The summer night had turned unexpectedly cold, yet it wasn't the chill making you tremble; it was something deeper, a fear that clung tighter than any storm. Your eyes sought mine briefly, searching desperately for solace, a lifeline that I, uncertain and startled, failed to provide.

"Someone from school," your voice wavered, each word fragile yet heavy with despair, "someone who tormented me endlessly. I didn't mean for it to happen. All I wanted was peace. But now, everything is lost."

Your confession lingered in the air, heavy and pleading, as if you were hoping I'd tell you that nothing was your fault—that everything could still be alright. But my thoughts tangled in confusion, my mind overwhelmed by shock and fear. I struggled to find the words you desperately needed to hear.

"I'll leave," you finally murmured, resignation creeping into your voice. "I'll disappear somewhere far away, somewhere no one will find me."

I stood silent, unable to offer you the simple comfort you craved. Instead, driven by my own uncertainty, I echoed your despair, pushing us both deeper into the darkness you had sought to escape.

"Then let me go with you," I said quietly, not realizing until later that I had merely reinforced your resolve instead of easing it.

Our eyes met again, yours briefly flickering with sadness, recognizing the absence of reassurance in my words. And thus, in mutual silence, beneath the unrelenting rain, we stepped forward into a summer that would saturate my heart with everlasting regret.`

		title: 'Chapter 1: Flight from Reality',
		content: `Our escape began quietly, each of us hurriedly preparing alone, gathering fragments of our separate lives into single, worn bags—essentials reduced to mere tokens of survival. In my bag, I packed a few clothes, some money I'd saved, a small knife whose presence felt heavy with implication, and an old handheld game console, a faint reminder of simpler days. You appeared shortly after, standing silently beneath the muted glow of the streetlamp, clutching your own small bag filled with similar items—clothes, a bit of cash, and personal things whose meaning I could only guess at, including a worn notebook whose edges were frayed from constant use.

Neither of us spoke as we stepped into the darkness outside, oppressive and thick, softened only by the lingering drizzle of summer rain. It felt surreal leaving behind homes we'd known separately yet equally well, now rendered unfamiliar, like remnants of dreams slipping rapidly from memory. The streets, usually comforting in their quiet familiarity, seemed strangely alien, reflecting our inner emptiness.

We moved swiftly, our footsteps quiet and hurried, each step further from familiarity bringing both liberation and anxiety. I stole glances at you, searching your expression for reassurance or perhaps hesitation, but found only quiet resignation and determination. The weight of our unspoken thoughts hung heavily between us, fragile and undisturbed by words.

Rain continued its relentless descent, washing over us, seemingly attempting to erase the past we both sought to escape. Deep within, guilt gnawed at my conscience; I realized, with a silent ache, that I'd failed to comfort you. Instead, I'd unintentionally reinforced your despair, plunging us both deeper into this uncertain reality.

In the distance, thunder murmured gently, and cicadas whispered softly through the trees, emphasizing the height of summer. The sky overhead darkened slightly, hinting at storms still unseen. As we moved forward into uncertainty, I couldn't help but wonder if we'd truly escaped, or merely exchanged one pain for another. And thus, our journey began—a killer and a useless person stepping into the unknown together.`

		title: 'Chapter 2: A World for Two',
		content: `We wandered aimlessly along rural roads, leaving behind the lights of our town until darkness fully enveloped us. Our destination was unclear, yet each step forward distanced us further from everything we knew. Eventually, we found ourselves on winding paths bordered by vast fields and sparse clusters of houses, each appearing quietly deserted beneath the soft glow of scattered streetlamps.

"Do you think anyone will come looking for us?" I asked, finally breaking the prolonged silence. My voice felt unfamiliar, echoing gently against the emptiness surrounding us.

You kept your gaze forward, expression guarded. "Maybe," you murmured softly. "But would it matter?"

We eventually arrived at a small, unnamed town dimly illuminated by the sterile glow of a single convenience store. The artificial brightness inside felt jarringly intrusive against the comforting darkness we'd grown accustomed to outside. You quietly moved toward the refrigerated drinks, while I browsed nervously through cheap, prepackaged meals and snacks.

"What should we get?" I asked, my voice quieter than intended.

"Just something inexpensive," you replied faintly, eyes fixed wearily on the rows of cold beverages.

We settled on simple rice balls and bottled water, paying quickly with dwindling cash. Sitting silently on a bench outside, the gentle hum of nearby vending machines provided an oddly comforting background noise.

Glancing down at the few coins and bills left in my wallet, anxiety began to creep in. "We're going through our money fast," I confessed softly, worry evident in my tone. "We won't last very long like this."

You briefly met my gaze, expression unreadable in the dim lighting. "We'll figure something out," you replied quietly, your voice calm yet distant, betraying nothing.

As we sat together beneath the pale glow of streetlights, I found myself reflecting on our strange situation. Despite attending the same school, sharing hallways and classrooms, we'd remained complete strangers. I'd observed you from afar, quietly noting your isolated lunches, your withdrawn presence during lessons, and your silent exits after school ended. In your solitude, I'd always felt a distant reflection of my own loneliness, a familiar emptiness mirrored in your quiet movements. We had each lived separately, unnoticed and unloved, trapped within invisible walls we'd never dared to break.

Strange, I thought bitterly, that two strangers could bond so easily simply because neither had ever truly felt loved. With that lonely truth binding us, we both instinctively believed in each other, finding solace in the shared darkness that had shaped us.

We finished our meal quickly, continuing our silent journey deeper into unfamiliar territory until exhaustion forced us to rest. Eventually, we stumbled upon an abandoned bus stop, its worn benches just wide enough to accommodate us both. The dark shelter felt temporary yet secure, a reflection of our uncertain circumstances.

"Are you scared?" you suddenly asked, voice hesitant yet sincere.

I hesitated, not wanting to hide the truth. "Yes," I admitted quietly. "But going back feels scarier."

Your eyes softened slightly, revealing a fleeting vulnerability. "Yeah," you murmured. "There's nothing for us there anyway."

We settled into silence again, listening to the whispering wind through distant fields. Sleep approached slowly, as we sat side by side, quietly accepting our shared uncertainty, neither of us daring to voice the deeper fears and doubts we both silently harbored.`

		title: 'Chapter 3: Summer Saturates',
		content: `Summer closed in around us, the heat oppressive, relentless, magnifying every restless thought swirling inside my mind. Each passing day blurred into the next, a cycle of merciless sunrises and weary nights filled with cicadas whose relentless cries echoed my inner torment.

Our money disappeared faster than anticipated, each purchase amplifying my sense of guilt. With each hunger pang, my conscience whispered that it was all my fault—my mistake, my weakness had led us here, dragging him along into this cruel uncertainty.

We stopped one afternoon beneath a sparse canopy of trees at the edge of an abandoned field, heat radiating fiercely off the cracked earth. I stole a glance at him, his expression distant, lost in thoughts I couldn't reach. My chest tightened painfully; he'd never asked for this, never deserved this torment.

"Do you think we made a mistake?" he finally asked, voice tinged with unease.

His words hit me like a wave of nausea, reinforcing every self-accusation I'd quietly harbored. I turned away, hiding the tremble in my voice. "It doesn't matter now, does it?" I whispered weakly, feeling the immense burden of guilt push down harder upon me.

He remained silent, the weight of his unanswered question hanging heavily in the suffocating air between us.

Nightfall brought little relief; we struggled to find adequate shelter, forced to sleep beneath open skies or under inadequate cover. Rest came fitfully, broken by restless dreams and anxious awakenings. Each morning brought renewed exhaustion, pulling me deeper into quiet despair.

One evening, unable to sleep, I found myself staring upward, losing myself in the vastness of the darkened sky, dotted with distant lights. My heart ached, silently pleading for comfort, for clarity. The stars seemed cold and distant, yet they held an inexplicable allure, as if their light could somehow reach into my darkness.

I sensed him stirring beside me, breaking my solitary moment. I tensed slightly, anxious yet oddly comforted by his presence. The silence stretched between us briefly until his voice gently pierced the quiet.

"You know," he began softly, carefully, as though he feared disturbing the fragile peace we'd found, "those stars—Deneb, Altair, and Vega—they form the Summer Triangle. Their light travels tens, even hundreds of years, just to reach us tonight. Even if the stars themselves have forgotten their brilliance, their glow still finds us."

I turned to him, my heart catching painfully at his words. Something delicate within me shifted, responding to the sincerity in his voice. "Far away," I murmured softly, echoing his sentiment, "a never-ending Betelgeuse. It's strange how magic like that connects two strangers."

He smiled faintly, gently reaching out, his hand hesitantly finding mine beneath the quiet darkness. "Even when things are tough, we'll move forward side by side, right?"

I nodded slightly, gripping his hand gently, the invisible lines connecting us feeling both reassuring and unbearably fragile beneath the vast, indifferent sky. Yet deep within, I couldn't silence the relentless voice that insisted I'd dragged him unwillingly into my darkness. The warmth of his hand, comforting yet fleeting, was not enough to dispel the growing shadow inside me.

As summer saturated every aspect of our existence, the distant stars watched silently, bearing witness to promises I feared we couldn't keep.`

		title: 'Chapter 4: Beneath the Stars',
		content: `The summer night was dense, carrying with it a heaviness that mirrored my own restless thoughts. We lay quietly beneath the vast sky, the world around us swallowed by darkness, leaving only the soft glitter of countless distant stars above.

I glanced over at her, noticing her gaze fixed upward, a lost and distant look in her eyes. Something about her quiet despair tugged painfully at my chest, making my heart ache in ways I couldn't fully articulate. I wanted to comfort her, to break through the silence, even if my words could never fully bridge the chasm growing silently between us.

The thought lingered heavily: Had we made a mistake? My question had remained unanswered earlier, yet it continued to echo within me, unresolved and filled with doubt.

Taking a gentle breath, I finally spoke, my voice soft yet steady. "You know, those stars—Deneb, Altair, and Vega—they form the Summer Triangle. Their light travels tens, even hundreds of years, crossing unimaginable distances just to reach us tonight. Even after their brilliance fades, their glow still finds us somehow. Maybe it's the same with us. Maybe we were meant to find each other, even if we can't see clearly why right now."

Her gaze shifted slightly, eyes now glistening softly in the dim starlight. She spoke quietly, almost whispering, "Far away, a never-ending Betelgeuse. It's strange how magic like that connects two strangers."

A fragile warmth stirred within me, intertwined with anxious fear. I desperately wanted to voice the feelings I'd buried deeply, yet caution held me silent, aware of how delicate our connection had become. Words felt inadequate, potentially harmful, like they might break something irreparable.

Instead, I reached out gently, my hand finding hers hesitantly in the quiet darkness. "Even when things are tough, we'll move forward side by side, right?" My voice was quiet, hopeful yet cautious, seeking reassurance amidst the uncertainty.

Her fingers tightened softly around mine, hesitant but real, offering a subtle affirmation that eased the tension just slightly. In the quietness beneath the vast sky, I silently promised myself never to forget this night—the gentle touch of her hand, the delicate words exchanged, and the stars quietly watching over us.

Some truths, I realized, might remain forever unspoken. Yet their silent presence illuminated my heart more vividly than any distant starlight ever could.`

		title: 'Chapter 5: Ephemeral Freedom',
		content: `Summer's grip tightened around us, the heat relentless, suffocating, pressing heavily against every step we took. Each day wore us down further, draining our energy and dimming the fragile light of hope we had once nurtured.

Our resources had nearly vanished, leaving hunger and exhaustion as our constant companions. Meals became sparse—carefully rationed rice balls, small bottles of water shared between us—barely enough to keep our bodies moving. The rural roads stretched endlessly, quiet and indifferent, lined with abandoned buildings and sparse convenience stores whose shelves mocked our dwindling coins.

One afternoon, we stopped beside an empty roadside stand, its once-bright paint faded, wood warped by exposure to countless summers. My stomach twisted painfully, hunger gnawing relentlessly. Glancing at her, I saw my own desperation reflected vividly in her tired eyes.

"We can't continue like this," I admitted softly, breaking the heavy silence.

She nodded slowly, eyes downcast, avoiding my gaze. "I know. But what choice do we have?" Her voice carried an edge of frustration, tinged with quiet resignation.

My heart tightened painfully. "Maybe... maybe we have to do something we wouldn't normally do," I suggested hesitantly, each word difficult to voice.

She looked sharply at me, her expression a mixture of alarm and reluctant understanding. "You mean steal?" she whispered, her voice barely audible, burdened with fear.

"I don't want to," I admitted, struggling to hold her gaze, "but if it means we survive…" My voice trailed off, heavy with unspoken guilt.

She turned away sharply, her shoulders trembling slightly, whether from anger, fear, or exhaustion, I couldn't tell. "Everything feels wrong," she whispered softly, voice strained. "I dragged you into this. Now we're considering things neither of us ever wanted. What have I done?"

Desperation surged within me, overriding my hesitation. I gently reached out, placing a comforting hand on her trembling shoulder. "It's not your fault," I assured quietly, though my own doubt clouded my words. "We'll figure it out together."

She remained silent, visibly retreating deeper into herself. I withdrew my hand, feeling helpless, the emotional gap widening despite our physical closeness.

That evening, beneath a collapsing bus shelter, we ate our last bits of food in tense silence. Darkness closed around us, deepening our isolation. Nearby, wilted flowers drooped, petals falling, crushed beneath the relentless heat, mirroring our fading strength.

"I'll do it," I suddenly spoke, voice stronger than I felt inside. "Whatever needs to be done."

She looked at me then, eyes wide with fear and sadness. "Are you sure?" Her voice wavered, heavy with worry.

I nodded slowly, feeling the weight of the decision pressing down. "If it keeps us alive, yes."

She sighed softly, turning away, hiding her tears in the shadows. "I'm so sorry," she whispered into the darkness, words filled with a pain I could hardly bear.

As night fell heavily around us, I stared at the dark sky, unable to see stars through the thick clouds overhead. Freedom, it seemed, had become ephemeral, slipping through our fingers as quickly as summer was fading away, leaving us trapped in choices we never imagined we'd face.`

		title: 'Chapter 6: First Sin',
		content: `Morning came like a stain on the sky—grey and breathless. There was no breeze. Even the cicadas, shrill prophets of the season, sounded distant. Muffled. Tired.

We walked without direction, not to escape, but simply to delay. Hunger was no longer a sensation; it had become an idea—sharp, abstract, ever-present. It existed somewhere between our thoughts and our silences. We passed by the first shop slowly. A bell jingled inside as someone came out, holding a sandwich. The smell nearly brought tears to my eyes.

She said nothing. Neither did I.

The second store was brighter, newer. A mother inside with a child tugging at her sleeve. My reflection in the glass looked like it didn't belong there. I kept walking.

The third store we stood in front of. It had dust on the windows. No customers. Just a slouched man at the counter flipping through a magazine. I watched him turn a page with a kind of divine indifference.

"I can't do it," I muttered. The words escaped me before I could dress them in bravery.

She looked at me then, not surprised, just tired. "I know."

And still, we kept walking. Each step sounded like it echoed too long. As if the world had hollowed itself out around us. A stage play of an ending.

By the time we reached the edge of town, I could no longer tell if it was cowardice or acceptance guiding me.

The final store appeared like a mirage, too quiet, too ordinary. A single door, a crooked sign. No cameras. No music. Just a man asleep in a chair behind the counter, mouth slightly open, arms crossed like he'd been waiting to be forgotten.

We stood across the street.

She didn't look at me.

I stepped forward.

The door opened with a chime that felt obscene. I could feel every particle of air press against my skin. I walked past the shelves like a ghost rehearsing a scene. Water. Bread. My hands moved before my mind did.

I thought, briefly, of poetry. Of hungry men in novels who stole apples and felt the shame only after the core had turned brown.

I thought, too, of how absurd it was—my entire life now resting on the weight of this plastic bottle.

I didn't run.

I walked out and didn't look back. She was already ahead of me, as if she couldn't bear to witness what I had become.

When we stopped, it was in the shadow of a narrow wall, the kind that collects heat and reflects silence. We sat.

I handed her the water. She took it like a confession.

"Thank you," she said.

The bread tasted of nothing. The water burned going down. I chewed like someone acting out the idea of eating. As if pretending hard enough might restore something.

"I thought I'd feel something," I said.

She didn't look at me. "You did."

"Did I?"

She turned, eyes unreadable. "You trembled."

We sat in that stillness, guilt quietly blooming between us like a weed. I no longer knew what was mine and what was hers. Only that something had changed.

A thread had been pulled.

The whole cloth would follow.

I looked down at my hands and thought: This is the shape of sin. It has no teeth. No claws. It is soft. It is simple. It is doing what must be done.

Heaven was still far off in the distance.

But the fall had already begun.`

		title: 'Chapter 7: The Distance Between',
		content: `The sky was pale and wide, drained of color. The heat had softened—not cooler, just quieter. It no longer scorched. It lingered. It hung in the air like breath not yet exhaled.

We walked side by side, the same way we always had. Her bag on one shoulder, mine on the other. Our footsteps were in rhythm, but we were not.

I don't remember when the silence began. Maybe it wasn't one moment. Maybe it crept in slowly, like everything else. One less question. One fewer glance. A softness in her voice replaced by nothing at all.

She stared ahead a lot now. Not cold. Just far away.

We passed a field of sunflowers—wilted, drooping toward the dirt. I almost said something about them. About how they used to follow the sun. But I didn't.

At a small rest stop, an old man offered us a bottle of cold barley tea. He didn't ask questions. Just smiled, said, "It's hot out today," and handed it to us like it meant nothing.

We bowed. She said thank you, barely above a whisper. I watched her hands as she took the bottle—thin, slow, deliberate. Like she was afraid of breaking something that had already cracked.

We drank in turns. The tea was sweet. It hurt.

That night, we found a quiet spot under a roadside overhang. Not quite shelter. Just shade. She laid out the thin blanket we shared. I placed my bag down next to hers, but left a little more space than usual.

She didn't look at me when she lay down. Just faced the other way, arms curled inward like she was trying to disappear into herself. I stared at the back of her head, the shape of her shoulders. I wanted to reach out. To say something.

Instead, I looked up at the stars. But tonight, they seemed more distant.

There was no fight. No collapse. No thunder in the sky.

Just space.

The kind that grows between two people who no longer know what to say.

I heard her breathing, slow and steady. Not asleep. Just pretending, maybe. Like me.

We had stolen to survive.

But now something else was slipping away.

That night, for the first time, we slept back to back.

And in that quiet distance, I realized: it wasn't the world that had abandoned us. It was us, drifting slowly from each other, too polite to scream.`
