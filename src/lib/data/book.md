The Season When Summer Saturated

A Confession In Lieu of a Preface

Forgive me. I have come to you with a book instead of a life.

I used to believe the righteous were merely loud, that their loudness could be mistaken for light. “Don’t say you want to die. Don’t give up. Live,” they sang—in the way a radio will scold an empty room. But my heart was a sly creature; it wished, with perfect hypocrisy, for everyone around me to live while thinking it would be no great catastrophe if I did not. This was not philosophy. It was simple egotism wearing a white tie.

I learned early how cheaply death travels: it floats along wires and flickers in screens; it knocks on the door of the indifferent and enters without taking off its shoes. Someone dies. Someone sings about it. A boy listens, is moved, picks up a knife, and sprints. We call it tragedy because the sprint is visible. We call the rest of it life.

If I have any excuse for speaking at such length, it is the oldest excuse in the world: I wanted to be your god. I wanted my poor song—my life—to make you cradle your own life more carefully. Even that was hunger disguised as benevolence, a commoner pretending to be a priest. What I really wanted was to be understood. I am ashamed of how many prayers are just explanations with incense.

I have arranged the following pages in the order in which a single soul stumbles: summer first, because summer always comes too soon; then the comedy of survival; then that humiliating promotion called adulthood; and after it, the hospital corridor of memory where footsteps are loud and nobody knows where to stand. Please read as you like. Chronology is a courtesy, not a law. The heart is a poor archivist. It stores everything by temperature.

I wrote because I didn’t want to die. If you think that is melodrama, you have not yet run out of ways to pass the afternoon.

I. Children of Early Summer

The day you arrived at my door, you were soaked to the bone, as if the long rains had pursued you up the stairwell. Your hair—the color of late June—clung to your cheeks. You said, in a voice that had been taught to be small, “I killed someone.” You said it as if it belonged to the weather report, third after humidity.

It was the boy who sat beside you at school, the one who had turned boredom into a profession and you into a hobby. “He shoved. I shoved back,” you said. “It was only a shoulder. But he fell wrong.” You pressed your damp palms to your face and waited for a disaster siren that did not sound. We both listened. The world went on eating noodles and arriving late to meetings.

“Then let’s go,” I said, because I had always been ready—ridiculously ready—to abandon everything in the name of you. “Wherever you’re going, take me.”

We inventoried our poverty. Two wallets, one knife, a handheld game with a saved level we could never return to, and a collection of photographs we were too cowardly to burn. You said you would die far away. I said, “I will come as far as the last train.” It is a sorry kind of romance that mistakes stubbornness for loyalty. But it has kept nations together.

We walked the rails as if they were lines we had been invited to read. Cicadas in the trees rehearsed their brief biographies at a volume that made honesty seem possible. We stole money we did not deserve to spend and ate food that tasted of shame and salt. We told each other jokes that were not jokes. We tried on the language of villains and found it roomy, like a coat you might grow into if given enough winters.

At dusk you practiced bravery with your hands. At midnight you gave it up. By morning you had decided on mercy: “It’s all right. I’ll die alone.” You said it as though you were letting me off a train before the end of the line.

On the afternoon of your performance, the sky wore the bright, stupid blue of a poster. Your face was colorless, an empty bowl. You stood very still, like a good student, and made a red smile at your throat with the knife that had traveled with us like an extra amulet. For a moment I thought it was theatre—one of those art-house films in which teenagers pay for their innocence with silence. Then I reacted like an adult: I shouted the name of a god whose handwriting I couldn’t recognize.

I was arrested before the cicadas finished their sentence. You were never “found,” a word that implies there exists a cupboard labeled Salvation into which we stuff the missing. I learned the bureaucratic grammar of grief: witness, custody, caution. Summer went on with its scandalous schedule—fireworks, festivals, people falling in love and calling it a plan.

There was a time in my life when I believed the right words could stop a blade. This book is the extinction of that belief.

II. A Manual for Survival (For Clumsy Men)

After that summer, I became a man of industrious cowardice. I did not drink much. I did not pray. I wrote.

Not because I was talented. Talent is a polite euphemism for appetite with manners. I wrote because the alternative was a narrow room and the police of my own mind. In a filthy apartment whose dust retired on every surface like a dull snow, I composed page after page of unfashionable sincerity with a pen that scratched like a mouse behind the wall. I told myself that I was “making art,” but the truth was plainer. I wanted a ladder tall enough to climb out of my skull.

I invented a you to replace the you who had politely excused herself from the world. She was always listening, always alive, always almost within reach. When my sentences pleased her, I pretended to be redeemed. When they failed, I pretended to be punished. This is not literature; it is worship with stationery.

People praised me and I was disgusted by my joy. It is a miracle how quickly praise curdles into shame in the mouths of the pious. I criticized my old teachers and better friends from the safety of my desk, which creaked approvingly whenever I hurt someone who would never read me. Some afternoons I wrote until I could taste iron. It felt noble, which is to say adolescent.

That was how I managed to not die: by pretending that finishing a paragraph was a form of survival. It is, in the way that swimming is a form of walking for the drowning.

III. Life Is A Comedy, If You Cannot Afford Tragedy

When you have nothing left to lose but your dignity, it is easy to be brave. I threw away my future like a man decluttering a room he never planned to enter. With the ceremonial air of the absurd, I declared that we were free: free to detest our city and love its ramen; free to curse at trains that arrived on time; free to run along the tracks like heroes dueling a camera.

Hope is an expensive word. I could not afford it. So I rented comedy. We laughed at things that were not funny, as a diet. We laughed at our poverty, at the thinness of our sleep, at the way we would always stumble over the exact same paving stone in front of the same bakery because habit is the only faithful god.

I told myself: We are not unfortunate; we are in rehearsal.

The rehearsals went on for years.

IV. Grown-Up

One morning I woke and found that the mirror had adopted a stranger with my eyebrows. My voice was tired. My skin had learned the geography of worry. Socks lay in the room like casualties. The trash muttered lessons in rot. Old classmates wrote to apologize for the small crimes of our youth, and I discovered I had been worse than them by the simple arithmetic of memory. What can I say? It is hard to keep accurate books when you are both the cashier and the thief.

My boss, a man who married his obligations and never cheated on them, bought me lunch. He watched me eat as if my appetite were an endangered bird he was rescuing. I wanted to repay him with some correct adult gesture; instead I allowed time to make a fool of me. Gratitude, when postponed, becomes superstition.

I learned simple adult facts with scandalous awe: summer is hot and winter is cold; there is a noun for every ungovernable feeling; survival is calories and steps. On rest days I visited establishments where intimacy is profession and emerged cleaner in the ledger but dirtier in the soul, which is a pleasing phrase until it is a habit.

Once, in the middle of an absolutely ordinary street, I began to cry without any talent for it. People were beautiful around me—so much so that I could hardly stand them—and I felt, with a clarity that seemed purchased from a more honest universe, that I was a fortunate man. Terror followed at once. Happiness always packs a parachute.

Growing up is learning that human beings are at once pathetic and gentle, and that we will not always know which we are being.

V. Inhuman

A rumor arose that I had misplaced my humanity. It wasn’t untrue. After a certain quantity of grief, the body becomes a museum of polite ghosts. I loved people as if they were lamps, useful for seeing my own furniture. I envied those whose blood still believed in thunder. Their laughter had height. Mine had grammar.

I asked someone to make me human again. I asked with the solemn vanity of a pilgrim who thinks the mountain will be flattered by his feet.

“Before your eyes pierce me,” I said, “let me learn how to be simple.” I danced after midnight on floors that did not know my name, left little wounds where the shoes rubbed, and counted them as proof of living. It was nothing. It was everything. I could not tell.

If I ever loved you, it was almost always with regret in advance.

VI. Bombs in the Sky

Summer returned with its obscene decorations. Fireworks went off over the river like tactless metaphors. I wrote letters I never sent:

Dear You,
When the town sweats and the cicadas make fun of us, I remember you as if remembering were a moral act. I wish to be your bomb—not to hurt you, but to rip open the polite walls you use when you speak to the world. My wish is criminal and therefore honest. The smoke smells like apology. I am trying to become a person whose apologies arrive on time.

The letters improved with the weather and never grew brave enough to leave my desk. It is one of life’s small desolations: our best tendernesses are unmailed.

VII. “Your Gone”

I came to understand that grammar is a kind of grief. “You’re gone” is a fact. “Your gone” is a wound, the clumsy mark a child leaves on a wall because it is the only surface that will listen. I feared I would become fluent in sorrow. It is a dangerous language—very easy to be eloquent, impossible to be original.

Someone told me you had said, once, “You are my everything.” I wanted to disclaim it on your behalf; I wanted to accept it and build an altar. Instead I folded it into my pillow and slept on it for years. I am not proud of this.

VIII. Give Me Back That Youth

Youth is a narcotic. It promises that everything will be forgiven and everything interesting will be punished. I wanted mine back the way a pickpocket wants his fingertips back after prison.

The catalogue of those days is embarrassing and holy: the aroma of a classroom left to its own devices, a guitar case dented by an alibi, a stray hair coiled in a corner like a future, a field trip that should have been a confession. The sun turned its face each afternoon and we pretended it was a message.

There are things I should have said. There are things I should have left unsaid. The list is not long and not short; it is eternal.

People tell me “We did our best” as if the past were a dinner bill we can split evenly. I want to say: No, we did not. But also—some days—I want to say: Yes, yes, we did. And on the days when I cannot afford philosophy, I scold myself for using the plural. I did not do my best. We is another kind of theft.

IX. When It’s Time To Die, Die Then

I have at last discovered a medicine strong enough to quiet the mold of death that grows along the edges of the mind. Here are the ingredients: hunger, sleep, the warm ignorance that money buys in small intervals, and the exquisite laziness of not hating anyone today.

“What is the meaning of life?” used to be my hobby. Then I got older and discovered that meaning is like salt: necessary, dangerous, cheap, and best when you stop noticing it. When it is time to die, die. Until then, eat—if you can. Work—if you must. Touch someone’s hand; forgive your hands for not being better. The monster who hurt you will probably die too. This is not justice. It is the policy of the universe, which is to say it is not a policy.

The rains stopped; laundry dried faster; the city smelled like its own breath. Somewhere in that weather I learned that being human is not an achievement. It is a permission slip you issue yourself each morning.

X. True Nature

Every consoling phrase eventually rots into an order. “You can start over,” they say, as if the self were a spreadsheet. “You can get it back,” they say, as if losses were merely misplaced and could be fetched from the drawer where we keep our unpaid fines.

I do not trust anyone who tells me I can be reborn. I have been born once already. It tired me out. Let someone else have a turn.

But I do trust sweating. I trust the body’s minor heroics—the way it repairs a small cut while you sleep, the way it requests water without submitting a form. I trust the fury that confirms you are not yet stone. I do not trust the pedagogy of strangers who want to turn my grief into a product.

“Live,” I say now, as an insult to despair. “Live,” I say now, without any wish to be anyone’s god. “Live,” because even the worst joke deserves a punchline.

XI. A Whole Universe In Your Lungs

Permit me a simple paragraph, a clean shirt among the rags.

You—whoever you are, and however you hate that word—you are practicing astronomy with every breath. Draw air and you swallow a milky river; let it out and you make a weather report. You are the custodian of a cosmos that continually unravels and reweaves itself in your chest. The world has lied to you about value. It has told you that numbers are nobler than lungs. It is mistaken.

If tonight the universe feels spoiled and the sky sounds like a closed door, let me be—quietly, without ceremony—a pill you take with water. I do not promise a cure. I promise company. Sometimes that is the same thing.

XII. Your Own Timepiece

Another tenderness I did not send:

Wake slowly. Coffee will forgive you for being late. Read a cheap paperback and believe it was written solely to prepare you for this bus, this bench, this wind. Eat what you can afford and bless it for not being more expensive. Look. Touch. Look again. Let me insist on your sovereignty: no one may certify you today. If they try, pass me their names and I will forget them for you.

No one measures you without your consent. No one kills you while I remember you. If fear slaps the cup from your hand, borrow my hands. If all else fails, we will nap like successful infants and declare the day a triumph.

XIII. Confession

I once told someone I loved them and the world did not applaud. Afterwards, I lived inside the echo for a season. Shame turned my spine to glass. We stopped speaking; we practiced the ancient art of walking past each other as if streets were tunnels and the other person had become air.

If I could go back, I would not unsay it. But I would refuse to be so theatrical about it. The heart is a very small theatre with an overworked lighting crew. I should have allowed them a night off.

Some nights I still dream we meet and make a childish promise: that tomorrow we will buy some cheap fruit and argue about which park is uglier. This, too, is worship. I am not proud. But I am not repentant either.

XIV. Cherry Blossom Child

Spring is the only season that knows how to end.

There was a girl once—there is always a girl—whose laughter was a precise instrument. She arrived and confiscated the makeshift podium on which my arrogance conducted its feeble speeches. She covered the air with petals like a thief covering a jewel. Then, as spring does, she disappeared into weather reports and the smug past tense. I walk the same street each March, hoping the air will commit a memory.

If I had been a cherry tree, I could have asked for the privilege of falling in company with her. We could have joined the dirt like conspirators and made a romance of decomposition. Instead I was a man. I did what men do: I lingered. I drafted metaphors until they made a kind of ash. I mistook recurrence for return.

This is not tragedy. It is agriculture. The heart is a field worked past sense.

XV. Glass Pen

Once, after a long illness called discouragement, I bought a glass pen. It was a foolish purchase for a foolish person. The nib held light like a throat holds laughter. I dipped it in darkness and was amazed by the quiet. After the old fever, silence is a handsome cloak.

Nothing came. I rediscovered an elementary truth: buying tools is not the same as having a life that deserves them.

I entertained the delightful thought that perhaps my “masterpiece” was to be not a book but a period of not writing. Then hunger—which is to say love—cleared its throat. I filled a page with small, practical sentences: I am not a poet. I am not an answer. I am a man washing a cup he forgot he used.

XVI. Passion of Twenty-Five O’Clock

There is a time just after midnight when the city takes attendance and discovers it has mislaid its bravest children. Some are in beds elaborately pretending to sleep. Some are gently vandalizing the future. A few are at windows, sanding the word loneliness down to a shape that fits in a pocket.

We all make oaths at that hour. We promise to keep the theorems of youth intact: that what is beautiful must be rescued; that what is cruelty must be named quickly; that tenderness is a form of civil disobedience; that we will not forget the world glitters even when it writhes.

By morning the oaths have turned into coffee grounds. Yet I believe them. I believe them in the way a gambler believes his luck is a person.

XVII. Got to Hell

I tried to be monstrous in order to excuse my smallness. It did not work. Even my sins lacked imagination. I threw away a pet because it did not understand my poetry. I ignored friends out of thrift. I confounded solitude with style. It would be noble to claim remorse changed me; in truth, ordinary fatigue did. I got tired of disappointing myself elegantly.

Sometimes I wanted to kill someone very specific: the version of me who kept saying “tomorrow.” But I could never find him. He had the same address as my courage.

One day, while I was rehearsing my villainy, cherry blossoms betrayed both of us by being lovely again. I hated them for their punctuality. I loved them for the same reason. This contradiction is the entire biography of my heart.

XVIII. The Boy and the Knife (An Interlude for Honesty)

Let us speak plainly once more. The boy at the tracks was not my lover. He was not my brother. He was a person whose pain I enjoyed the dignity of observing. It makes me gag to confess it. The human animal will justify any intimacy so long as it can be narrativized. I narrated until my tongue was a liar.

He left me with a curriculum: learn the price of slogans; learn the cost of looking away; learn that guilt is an energy source you must not steal from other people. I am a poor student. I still copy from my neighbor’s conscience.

XIX. What For?

Why does love embitter the gentle and dignify the vulgar? Why do the kindest hands tremble? Why does anger arrive wearing the perfume of justice? Why, when I adore you, do I become unpresentable?

I have been called dramatic for asking. But if life is a classroom, what use is a blackboard no one will chalk? I would rather be scolded for speaking than praised for my posture.

There is a hunger in us that cannot tell the difference between truth and a good story. I know this and keep writing. Please treat my pages as you would treat a stranger’s umbrella: borrow them without ceremony and return them when the weather changes.

XX. The Eventual Instruction

You will die, of course. So will I. The revelation is not that we perish. The revelation is that we are permitted to continue long enough to regret it and long enough to laugh. The revelation is that shame can be repurposed into tenderness. The revelation is that one day you will find yourself buying fruit and realize: this is the hymn, this is the flag, this is the point.

If anyone asks what I learned, tell them this: I did not become your god. I became, at last, a man patient enough to sit beside your sorrow without giving it orders. On good days, I can make room on the bench.

Live. Not because it is noble. Not because I insist. Live because your lungs are galaxies, because coffee forgives, because the train has more stations than grief told you, because the summer that ruined you also taught you the sound that cicadas make when they vote for life.

Then, when it is time, die. Let that be the final obedience to a world that, despite its unprofessional management, stubbornly produces evenings. Between now and then, I will keep writing—clumsily, greedily, like a man who has misplaced a door and is drawing a house around himself in order to be believed.

If you need me, look for the bench where the tired sit and pretend it is a throne. I will be there, not wise, not cured, only less theatrical—glad for your company, and finally, at last, at last, alive enough to listen.
