		title: `spring comes; I'm bruised and broken`,
		content: `This must be love because I don't know what else to call it.
How can I exemplify "you and me"?
I bite down and taste the sand in my mouth—
Then I kneel in evening-wet grass and rehearse living.
“Isn’t it too early to end?” I ask my restless heart.
I kept the pain inside until it learned your name.
Keep me, even broken—
I am not finished ending yet.`
	},
	{
		title: `this hole in my chest, can't hold any love`,
		content: `Emotions and feelings are useless to keep.
The tears that had fallen were not mine to weep.
The kindness and warmth, I can't feel them at all.
The hands that are offered, I'm scared that I'll fall`
	},
	{
		title: `the space between us`,
		content: `Can't we entertain the idea?
You rejected it so quickly, my heart sank.
I repeat your words like I rehearsed it.`
	},
	{
		title: 'something like that',
		content: `Whiskey shall be my undoing;
I've never known a poison so gentle in its cruelty.
I breathe in smoke like air,
as if nicotine could fill the emptiness of a hollowed soul.
Here I stand, stripping my heart bare,
leaving it to decay in the open air.`

	{
		title: 'stained',
		content: `Even if these moments never come to pass again.
these words will not vanish.
They will be burned into our chest,
and refused to disappear.`
	},
	{
		title: 'heavy silence',
		content: `If I were cruel, I would change something.
Instead, I memorize your footsteps between the till and me.
It’s a small map; it leads everywhere I cannot go.`
	},
	{
		title: 'are you okay?',
		content: `I am—when you don’t look.
When you do,
I am tormented by the wish to answer honestly.`
	},
	{
		title: ':)',
		content: `I’m so immature that, in the blink of an eye, I miss the sight of your smile.
If that is so, then I’d rather remain unaware of it to begin with.`
	},
	{
		title: 'I would risk it all',
		content: `Once you’ve tasted poison, you might as well savour it to the last bitter drop.
What use is restraint when ruin already runs through your veins?
I would risk it all—even if it destroys me—what could be a worthier end?`

	{
		title: 'the weight of fleeting things',
		content: `No matter how mundane, those days were real.
They’ll turn into memories, sure, but never into lies.
We will never become lies, right?`

	{
		title: 'museum of almosts',
		content: `Every night I curate the exhibits:
the hug I didn’t take,
the train I watched depart,
the life that bowed and left without applause.`

		content: `Clear morning: I believe.
Clouding by noon: I bargain.
Midnight rain: I remember too much.`

		title: 'white, once',
		content: `how many colours have we been stained with?
i remember a white ocean i walked—each step darkening,
until the path became ink.
if i keep going, will it write me out?`

	{
		title: 'chronicles of a dream',
		content: `a daydream: a tiny city atop a palette.
a shower of stardust waltzes, dancing in ink.
hide-and-seek in the oort’s seams.
i wander, aimless,
until the night lays me down—gently.`
