Instead, I memorize your footsteps between the till and me.
It’s a small map; it leads everywhere I cannot go.`

If that is so, then I’d rather remain unaware of it to begin with.`

What use is restraint when ruin already runs through your veins?
I would risk it all—even if it destroys me—what could be a worthier end?`

They’ll turn into memories, sure, but never into lies.
We will never become lies, right?`

the hug I didn’t take,
the train I watched depart,
the life that bowed and left without applause.`

Clouding by noon: I bargain.
Midnight rain: I remember too much.`

i remember a white ocean i walked—each step darkening,
until the path became ink.
if i keep going, will it write me out?`

a shower of stardust waltzes, dancing in ink.
hide-and-seek in the oort’s seams.
i wander, aimless,
until the night lays me down—gently.`
